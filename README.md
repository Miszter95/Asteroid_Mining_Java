# Asteroid Mining - Java

Humanity has decided to exploit the potential of asteroid mining. To do this, colonists need to build a space base in the asteroid belt. The resources required for construction would be too expensive to transport there, so they must be extracted from the asteroids.

More details about this project in the Aszteroida_Banyaszat_dokumentum.pdf file.

# To run the project from the command line

1. Add the javac and java executables to the $PATH environment variable with the following command:
set path=%path%;C:\ProgramFiles\Java\Java\jdk-11.0.2\bin
(Replace the version number as appropriate, if necessary.)


2. Navigate to the Asteroid_Mining_Java\Program\bin folder in the command line.

3. Execute this command: java aszteroida_banyaszat.Main
